todo
------------------------
Add medium and large bootstrap modals
clear unit info after turn switch
Unit class wrapper (e.g. getWarrior({param: value, etc.}))
redo board terrain mapping(to a 2d array?)
Make it so units can pass other friendly units on the board(occupiedBy goes to array)
extract internal tests out into a module
arrow attack animation for archer(transparent image rotation)
------------------------


Design Decisions
---------------------
Everything is driven from the data structure - the game board
Full team turns or speed based turns?
 - full teams. So speed is just number of squares to move

click move, shows possible moves with indicators
can move unit freely in area, the move button has changed to two buttons, stay and cancel
move isn't an option now
click attack, show unit's attack range
clicking an enemy unit in range will prompt a confirmation to attack
if yes, animation, sound, and damage all happen, and that unit's turn is over
