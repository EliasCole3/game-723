Design Decisions
---------------------
Everything is driven from the data structure - the game board
Full team turns or speed based turns?
 - full teams. So speed is just number of squares to move

---------------------


Features
---------------------
Determine possible move squares
Limit movement to possible moves
Range finding algorithm
non-unit map obstructions

---------------------


Game Flow
---------------------
Select settings
Start game
player1 is selected
select one of player1's units
shows that units info, and actions that can be taken(move, attack, defend, items)
click move, shows possible moves with indicators
can move unit freely in area, the move button has changed to two buttons, stay and cancel
move isn't an option now
click attack, show unit's attack range
clicking an enemy unit in range will prompt a confirmation to attack
if yes, animation, sound, and damage all happen, and that unit's turn is over
